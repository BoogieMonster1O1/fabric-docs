# Wiki Meta

### I want to contribute to the Fabric Wiki, how do I get edit access?

Create an account on the wiki, go to the \#wiki channel on the Fabric
Discord, and ping Asie with your wiki username and state that you
request wiki editing access.

### Creating a new page

Search for the page name you want to create, when not found click on the
link on:

`...you can create or edit the page :a_new_page, named after your
query.`

or, just type the URL in your browser, for example to create a page
named `a_new_page` under `tutorial`

`https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:a_new_page?do=edit`
