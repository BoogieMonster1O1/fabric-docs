# Install/Verify Java

The Minecraft Launcher has a bundled Java runtime, but you will need to have a Java runtime installed if you use MultiMC or if you want to use an specific Java Runtime other than the bundled one in a Minecraft Launcher "Installation"

You will also need to have a Java runtime installed if you use the jar version of the Fabric Installer.

## STEP 1: Verify if Java is already installed

Open the Run dialog by using the Windows+R hotkey. Enter cmd in the textbox and click OK This will open a command window.

## STEP 2 Uninstall previous Java versions

## STEP 3 Install Java

To download the Java installer, go [here](https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html)
