## Install/Verify Java

The Minecraft Launcher has a bundled Java runtime, but you will need to
have a Java runtime installed if you use MultiMC or if you want to use
an specific Java Runtime other than the bundled one in a Minecraft
Launcher "Installation"

You will also need to have a Java runtime installed if you use the jar
version of the Fabric Installer.
