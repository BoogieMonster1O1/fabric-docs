# Wiki Agenda

Welcome to the agenda page for the Fabric Wiki. This is a dynamic list
of the things that the wiki team has plans to do in the future and has
currently prioritized. If you wish to contribute to the wiki and tackle
some of the items on this list, come over to the [Fabric
Discord](https://discord.gg/v6v4pMv)'s \#wiki channel to request write
access. (Read the rules first\!)

## Wiki Goals

- Better visibility for Fabric mods. Provide a way to discover mods
  (even if its as simple as a list).
  - In the future, we can look to create either a custom site or
    plugin for search functionality & other improvements.
  - Link to and/or create tutorials for some ubiquitous mods
- Fabric third-party library/API reference. Create a place where
  modders can see and use what has already been created so that they
  do not reinvent the wheel a thousand times over.
